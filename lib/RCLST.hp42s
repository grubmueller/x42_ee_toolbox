# RCLST: Recall stack
#
# The "STOST" and "RCLST" programs store and recall the stack registers X, Y, Z,
# T and L to/from variables "ST_X", "ST_Y", "ST_Z", "ST_T" and "ST_L". The stack
# stays unchanged after "STOST". The variables are deleted after execution of
# "RCLST", so it can only be run once after "STOST".
